📌 Next Milestones in Node.js Project:


1. Multiple Consumers

Right now, you only have order-consumer.
We’ll add more consumers to act like different microservices:

Order Consumer → Handles booking, shipping, delivery updates.

Shipping Consumer → Listens for ORDER_SHIPPED events, maybe adds shipping details.

Notification Consumer → Listens for status changes and sends mock notifications (log/email/sms simulation).

👉 This teaches you Kafka Pub/Sub pattern where multiple consumers read from the same event stream.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)

Sometimes, consumers fail to process messages (e.g., DB error, invalid data).
We’ll implement:

A retry mechanism (try 3 times).

If it still fails → push the event to a orders.DLQ topic.

DLQ will store bad messages for later debugging.

👉 This mirrors real-world resilience.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Replay Events

In event-driven systems, we often need to replay past events (e.g., to rebuild a service state after crash).

We’ll build a Replay Service:

Reads from DLQ or archived topics.

Replays messages into the main topic.

Consumers reprocess them to rebuild state.

👉 This teaches you event sourcing mindset.

4: Add a Monitoring Dashboard

Build a small web dashboard showing:

All orders and their current status.

Event logs.

Real-time updates using WebSocket or polling.

5: Need to create a good logging in this project
