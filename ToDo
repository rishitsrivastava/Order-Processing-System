ðŸ“Œ Next Milestones in Node.js Project:


1. Multiple Consumers

Right now, you only have order-consumer.
Weâ€™ll add more consumers to act like different microservices:

Order Consumer â†’ Handles booking, shipping, delivery updates.

Shipping Consumer â†’ Listens for ORDER_SHIPPED events, maybe adds shipping details.

Notification Consumer â†’ Listens for status changes and sends mock notifications (log/email/sms simulation).

ðŸ‘‰ This teaches you Kafka Pub/Sub pattern where multiple consumers read from the same event stream.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)

Sometimes, consumers fail to process messages (e.g., DB error, invalid data).
Weâ€™ll implement:

A retry mechanism (try 3 times).

If it still fails â†’ push the event to a orders.DLQ topic.

DLQ will store bad messages for later debugging.

ðŸ‘‰ This mirrors real-world resilience.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Replay Events

In event-driven systems, we often need to replay past events (e.g., to rebuild a service state after crash).

Weâ€™ll build a Replay Service:

Reads from DLQ or archived topics.

Replays messages into the main topic.

Consumers reprocess them to rebuild state.

ðŸ‘‰ This teaches you event sourcing mindset.

Option 4: Add Persistent Storage

Currently, your services may only log data.

Use a database (like MongoDB or PostgreSQL) for:

Orders (status, items, user)

Shipments (tracking info)

Notifications (history/logs)
